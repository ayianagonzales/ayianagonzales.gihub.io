<p> Hi!! Welcome to My Photography Blog!!
    My name is Ayiana Gonzales and I'm 14 years old.
    This website was built from my very own HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT in a Steam Coders class I took over the summer. This is a practice website which I will hopefully learn lots from to be able to 
   construct one later on when needed.</p>
